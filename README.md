# Mobile Target Tracking
This code compilation is a result of my (Sarah Morgan's) SM thesis here: [[3]](#3). Several case studies are shown there with a more in-depth discussion of this procedure of adaptable maneuver planning.

## Motivation
This code (primarily in Python) can be used to plan sequential low thrust maneuvers for satellites tracking a mobile target- particularly, this has been used for tracking hurricanes as in [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2), and [[3]](#3).  This is enabled by an analytical solution for low-thrust three-phase maneuvers [[4]](#4).  

## Summary of Approaches
Several methods for maneuver planning are included in this Github. Each of these show possible sequential maneuver solutions to achieve accesses of the mobile target at defined target locations with associated target times. Each essentially follow the following process:
* targets are defined along the hurricane track, each with some _viewing window_ (i.e. the satellite should view the storm at 10/10/2010 12:00 UTC +/- 20 hours)
    * the hurricane track will be interpolated between available points to approximate its location at each point in time in the model
* satellite(s) initialized at epoch with given initial conditions
* the satellite maneuvers with some delta-V (according to the approach used) over a fixed maneuver duration
* the satellite is then propagated (no delta-V applied) over the fixed _viewing window_
* storm accesses are recorded
* several delta-V options are attempted, according to the approach used
    * if there are no accesses recorded for a given target, the satellite will propagate through this maneuver duration (no delta-V applied)

All of the resulting delta-V solutions and associated storm accesses are recorded and presented according to the methods described below (i.e. displayed in a tree as the output of the graph theory approach or shown as a non-dominated set as the output from optimization). 

### Inputs
Each of these methods require the following inputs:
* initial satellite(s) state (can include multiple satellites)
    * orbit altitude
    * orbit inclination
    * initial right ascension of ascending node (_RAAN_)
    * initial argument of latitude (_u_ - some places this may be _AOL_)
    * epoch
    * right ascension of Greenwich at epoch
* satellite mass
* satellite maximum thrust capability
* target track to be used

The following assumptions are made:
* J2 effects only are included
* only circular orbits are used
* the general perturbation analytical solution is used for both propagation and raising/lowering maneuvers (an approximation as opposed to something like a numerical solution)
* initial and ending altitude of the three-phase maneuvers are the same
* model parameters:
   * mean Earth radius: 6371000 m
   * Earth flattening parameter: 0.00335281
   * angular velocity of the Earth: 7.29212*10^(-5) rad/s
   * standard gravitational parameter: 3.98600*10^(14) m^3/s^2
   * coefficient of the Earth's gravitational zonal harmonic of the 2nd degree (J2): 1082.7*10^(-6)

## __Graph theory approach__:
### Description:
(Python) this is similar to the approach used by McGrath et al. [[1]](#1). Possible maneuvers are displayed in a tree- this involves discretizing the maneuver space. For example, the satellite will maneuver from epoch with some delta-V (i.e. 0.5m/s, 1 m/s, 1.5 m/s). This delta-V step size can be adjusted. In this graph theory approach, each satellite state is a node, maneuvered to the next state by an edge of some delta-V. So, for example, a satellite will begin at node 0, maneuver with 0.5m/s, 1m/s and 1.5m/s, attempting to view Target 1. Each of these maneuver options are shown as edges branching from node 0, creating nodes 1, 2, and 3. Then, the satellite will maneuver from each of these states attempting to view Target 2, and so on. This will create a graph of possible maneuvers, with each branch representing a possible set of sequential maneuvers.  In this particular code, the NetworkX package [[5]](#5) was used to create the graph. 


There are a number of ways to analyze the resulting graph. Currently, the shortest path (lowest delta-V) is recorded, found through Dijkstra’s method as in <a id="1">[1]</a>. 


### Process:
The process as described above is shown in the flowchart below. 
Note in the code a negative delta-V corresponds to a lowering maneuver (delta-V applied opposite the satellite velocity vector) and a positive delta-V (delta-V applied in the direction of the satellite velocity vector) corresponds to a raising maneuver.

### Output
The result of this is a graph of possible manuever options with the lowest delta-V solution (the graph as generated by NetworkX and the satellite states at each node). An image of the graph can be generated as well with the lowest delta-V solution highlighted. 

#### Example (using Typhoon Megi case study)
For a 3 target optimization with delta-V options of (-5:0.5:5 m/s) per manuever, this approach takes around 20 seconds to produce results on a PC with 16 GB RAM (CPU: Intel Core i7 @ 1.9GHz). Note this will take an exponentially greater amount of time with more targets (increasing tree depth). 

A resulting graph plot is below:

## __Optimization (GA) approach__
### Description:
(Python) this approach utilizes continuous exploration of possible delta-V space. Rather than plan all possible manevuers with a graph approach, a gentic algorithm searches the space of possible delta-V usage continously. In this particular case, pymoo [[6]](#6) was used to enable multiple objective optimiation. 

### Process:
The process as described above is shown in the flowchart below. 
Note in the code a negative delta-V corresponds to a lowering maneuver (delta-V applied opposite the satellite velocity vector) and a positive delta-V (delta-V applied in the direction of the satellite velocity vector) corresponds to a raising maneuver.

### Output

#### Example (using Typhoon Megi case study)
For a 3 target optimization with delta-V options of (-5:0.5:5 m/s) per manuever, this approach takes around 4.2 minutes to produce results on a PC with 16 GB RAM (CPU: Intel Core i7 @ 1.9GHz).

## __GUI Framework__
(Matlab and Python) this interface would allow a user to define external inputs, which will display the output of the optimization approach. This code is not yet complete (integration of python files with Matlab interface required). The mock-up below is generated by the file 'mobile_target_gui.m' - this file can be adjusted to generate results from the inputs given.

## __Future Work__
An approach that is discussed in [[3]](#3) includes utilizing forecasted track data. This can be created by simply adjusting the inputs for the 'series_of_maneuvers.py' file and loading different target data for each updated forecast.

## How to Use
- Download all code in this repository. 

- The following packages are needed in addition to the defaults included with Anaconda installation. (with Python version 3.7.10)
    - matplotlib (version 3.4.2 used)
        - (!) Note: there appears to be an incompatibility with older versions of networkx and matplotlib- if you get a matplotlib error, check your versions
    - networkx (version 2.4 used)
    - numpy (version 1.20.0)
    - openpyxl (version 3.0.7 used)
    - pygraphvix or pydot (version 1.7 used)
    - pymoo (version 0.4.2.2)

- The graph theory and genetic algorithm approaches can be run by files [graph_theory.py](graph_theory.py) and [optimization_GA.py](optimization_GA.py) respectively.
 
- Inputs (i.e. mission scenario variables like ground tracks to be used, satellite initial states, etc) to be changed for each approach are in [graph_theory.py](graph_theory.py) and [series_of_maneuvers.py](series_of_maneuvers.py) respectively. 
    - Any changes to the optimizer should be made in [optimization_GA.py](optimization_GA.py). 


Some notes that may be helpful for beginner coders (like me!):
- I recommend using Anaconda for easier package managment (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) and convenient IDE Spyder! I used Python version 3.7, and set up a virtual environment for this. 
- Adjust file paths as needed (this was done on a Windows machine, filepath may be needed to change on other OS).
